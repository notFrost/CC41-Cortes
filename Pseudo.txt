-Comparing Function (in between every cycle)
Max X and Max Y > Make Used Area
Wasted Area = Ocupied Area - Sum of Used Area  (Value, not %)
Choose top 2 Least wasted Area as New Parent Root Nodes

Run Algorithm Again with the nodes that are missing

-2nd
Upon full Cycle Run Algorithm with unused Packages, 
	comparing not just with last Package but every Package in the Bin

Repeat cycle until the best answer of one cycle is the same as the one before
	(aka there was no change)

Choose top 1 Least wasted Area as 1st Canvas.

if there are unused nodes,
	run algorithm from the start with unused nodes to fill out any subsequent Canvases
